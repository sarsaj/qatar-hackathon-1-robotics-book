# Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

This chapter covers the essential concepts of robot localization, mapping, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

## Content Placeholder

[Provide detailed content about different localization techniques (e.g., GPS, odometry, visual odometry), mapping algorithms (e.g., occupancy grids, point clouds), and various SLAM approaches (e.g., EKF-SLAM, graph-based SLAM, visual SLAM).]

## Code Examples

```cpp
// Conceptual C++ code for a simple pose update in a SLAM system
// (Highly simplified for illustration)
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense> // Requires Eigen library for matrix operations

// Represents a robot's pose (x, y, yaw)
struct Pose {
    double x, y, yaw;
};

// Function to update robot's pose based on odometry
Pose update_pose_odometry(const Pose& current_pose, double delta_distance, double delta_yaw) {
    Pose new_pose;
    new_pose.x = current_pose.x + delta_distance * std::cos(current_pose.yaw + delta_yaw / 2.0);
    new_pose.y = current_pose.y + delta_distance * std::sin(current_pose.yaw + delta_yaw / 2.0);
    new_pose.yaw = current_pose.yaw + delta_yaw;
    return new_pose;
}

int main() {
    Pose initial_pose = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // Start at origin, facing X-axis
    double distance_moved = 1.0;         // Move 1 meter
    double rotation_angle = M_PI / 4.0;  // Rotate 45 degrees

    Pose new_pose = update_pose_odometry(initial_pose, distance_moved, rotation_angle);

    std::cout << "Initial Pose: (" << initial_pose.x << ", " << initial_pose.y << ", " << initial_pose.yaw << ")\n";
    std::cout << "New Pose (Odometry): (" << new_pose.x << ", " << new_pose.y << ", " << new_pose.yaw << ")\n";

    return 0;
}
```

## Architecture Diagrams

[Insert architecture diagrams illustrating different components of a SLAM system (e.g., sensor input, front-end, back-end, loop closure).]

## Launch Files

[Insert launch file examples for starting ROS 2 nodes for LiDAR odometry, visual odometry, mapping algorithms (e.g., Cartographer, GMapping, VSLAM packages).]

## Simulation Configurations

[Insert simulation configuration details for setting up environments suitable for SLAM testing, including sensor noise models and ground truth data.]
