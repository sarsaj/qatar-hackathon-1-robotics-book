# Voice-to-Action

This chapter delves into the process of translating human voice commands into actionable instructions for robots, with a focus on speech recognition and natural language understanding.

## Content Placeholder

[Provide detailed content about speech-to-text technologies (e.g., OpenAI Whisper), natural language processing (NLP) for command interpretation, and mapping parsed commands to robotic primitives.]

## Code Examples

```python
# Conceptual Python code for speech-to-text (using a placeholder library)
class SpeechToText:
    def __init__(self, model_api_key):
        self.client = SpeechToTextClient(model_api_key) # Placeholder

    def transcribe_audio(self, audio_data):
        return self.client.transcribe(audio_data)

# Conceptual Python code for natural language understanding (NLU)
class NaturalLanguageUnderstanding:
    def __init__(self, nlu_model):
        self.model = nlu_model # Placeholder for an NLU model

    def parse_command(self, text_command):
        # Example: "move forward 1 meter" -> {"action": "move", "direction": "forward", "distance": 1.0, "unit": "meter"}
        parsed_intent = self.model.process(text_command)
        return parsed_intent

# Usage (conceptual)
# stt = SpeechToText("whisper_key")
# nlu = NaturalLanguageUnderstanding(NLUModel())
#
# # Simulate audio input
# audio = b"..." # raw audio data
# text = stt.transcribe_audio(audio)
# command_params = nlu.parse_command(text)
# print(f"Parsed command: {command_params}")
```

## Architecture Diagrams

[Insert architecture diagrams illustrating the voice-to-action pipeline, including speech recognition, NLP, and the interface with robot control systems.]

## Launch Files

[Insert launch file examples for integrating speech recognition nodes (e.g., ROS 2 nodes for Whisper), or NLP processing nodes into a robotic system.]

## Simulation Configurations

[Insert simulation configuration details for setting up environments to test voice command interpretation, including audio input simulation or text command injection.]
