# Cognitive Planning

This chapter explores how robots can perform high-level reasoning and planning, often guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), to achieve complex goals.

## Content Placeholder

[Provide detailed content about symbolic planning, hierarchical task networks (HTN), goal-oriented action planning, and how LLMs can be used to generate or refine these plans for robotic systems.]

## Code Examples

```python
# Conceptual Python code for a simple cognitive planner generating a sequence of actions
class CognitivePlanner:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.kb = knowledge_base # Placeholder for a knowledge base

    def plan_task(self, high_level_goal):
        print(f"Planning for goal: {high_level_goal}")
        # In a real system, this would involve complex reasoning
        if "fetch cup" in high_level_goal:
            return ["navigate_to_table", "detect_cup", "grasp_cup", "navigate_to_shelf", "place_cup"]
        elif "open door" in high_level_goal:
            return ["navigate_to_door", "approach_handle", "grasp_handle", "turn_handle", "push_door"]
        else:
            return ["unknown_action"]

# Usage (conceptual)
# planner = CognitivePlanner(KnowledgeBase())
# plan = planner.plan_task("fetch cup from the table")
# print(f"Generated plan: {plan}")
```

## Architecture Diagrams

[Insert architecture diagrams illustrating cognitive planning architectures, including components like LLMs, knowledge bases, planners, and action executors.]

## Launch Files

[Insert launch file examples for starting ROS 2 nodes that manage task planning, state machines, or behavior trees derived from cognitive plans.]

## Simulation Configurations

[Insert simulation configuration details for creating complex environments with dynamic objects and scenarios suitable for testing cognitive planning capabilities.]
