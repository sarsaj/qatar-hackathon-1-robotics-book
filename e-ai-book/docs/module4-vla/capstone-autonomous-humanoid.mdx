# Capstone: End-to-End Autonomous Humanoid System

This capstone chapter integrates all previously discussed concepts to present a complete vision-language-action pipeline for an autonomous humanoid robot.

## Content Placeholder

[Provide detailed content about the end-to-end architecture for an autonomous humanoid, integrating voice input, LLM planning, perception, navigation, and manipulation. Discuss challenges and future directions.]

## Code Examples

```python
# Conceptual Python code illustrating the main loop of an autonomous humanoid system
class AutonomousHumanoid:
    def __init__(self, vla_pipeline):
        self.vla = vla_pipeline # Placeholder for the integrated VLA system

    def run_cycle(self):
        # 1. Perceive environment
        percepts = self.vla.perceive()

        # 2. Interpret commands (e.g., from voice or high-level goals)
        high_level_goal = self.vla.interpret_goal(percepts)

        # 3. Plan actions using LLM-based cognitive planning
        action_plan = self.vla.plan_actions(high_level_goal, percepts)

        # 4. Execute actions
        self.vla.execute_plan(action_plan)

        print(f"Humanoid executed: {action_plan}")

# Usage (conceptual)
# vla_system = IntegratedVLAPipeline() # Assuming this integrates all sub-components
# humanoid = AutonomousHumanoid(vla_system)
#
# while True:
#     humanoid.run_cycle()
#     import time
#     time.sleep(5)
```

## Architecture Diagrams

[Insert comprehensive architecture diagrams showing the full VLA pipeline for a humanoid, highlighting the interaction between all modules (vision, language, planning, action).]

## Launch Files

[Insert launch file examples for launching a fully integrated autonomous humanoid system, combining ROS 2 nodes for perception, navigation, manipulation, and VLA interfaces.]

## Simulation Configurations

[Insert detailed simulation configuration for a complete humanoid robot in a complex environment, allowing for testing of the full VLA pipeline from command interpretation to physical interaction.]
